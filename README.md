A trustless, on-chain Over-the-Counter (OTC) trading platform for **Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs)**, secured entirely by an Algorand smart contract.

---

## 📖 Overview
This project provides a **fully decentralized solution** for two parties to securely swap specific amounts of ASAs **without counterparty risk**.  

Unlike Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), which are optimized for liquid, order-book-based trading, this platform is designed for **larger, less liquid, or highly specific trades** that are typically arranged off-chain.

---

## ❌ The Problem
Currently, conducting large or specific ASA trades requires **off-chain communication** and a **high degree of trust** between parties, or complex, manual multi-signature escrow setups.  

This process is:
- Inefficient ⚡
- Prone to scams ⚠️
- Introduces significant counterparty risk ❌  

There is **no native, on-chain mechanism** to facilitate these trustless OTC deals.

---

## ✅ The Solution
An **Algorand Smart Contract** that acts as a trustless **escrow and atomic swap agent**.

- A **Maker** creates an on-chain offer by depositing their assets into the smart contract.  
- A **Taker** accepts the offer by depositing their corresponding assets.  
- The smart contract automatically and atomically **executes the swap**, ensuring **both sides happen or neither does**.  

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Offer Creation**: Public or private offers with ASA details, quantities, and expiration.  
- **Trustless Escrow**: Maker’s assets are locked in the smart contract.  
- **Atomic Swap Execution**: Instant asset swaps without counterparty risk.  
- **Dispute Resolution & Refunds**: Expired offers can be reclaimed by the Maker.  
- **Private Trades**: Offers restricted to a specific Algorand address.
